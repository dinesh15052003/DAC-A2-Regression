# Problem Statement 
This is a data of 50 Startups. It has features like R&D Spend, Administration Cost, Marketing Cost, State of the StartUp and its Profit.
We are going to find the relation between the profit and other features.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [50_Startups](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandobordi/50startups) from (Kaggle).

If the task is a regression task, then explain the target variable and give brief statistics.

**Target Variable: Profit**
<br>
<br>
Profit refers to the profit earned by the Startup.
<br>
**Mean Profit:** 112012.6392
<br>
**Max Profit:** 192261.83
<br>
**Min Profit:** 14681.40


## Model(s) Used

I have used a simple LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL.

## Future Work
We can use Deep Learning i.e. Artificial Neural Networks for a better acccuracy score.
